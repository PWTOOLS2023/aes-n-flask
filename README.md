# aes_n_flask

This is my school cryptographic project's main part.

I have started working on it in May 2022 (8th school grade), and finally presented it in March 2023.

## Usage HOWTO
To launch this project, you need to
- clone it locally using `git clone`
- launch `src/app.py` file with `python3 src/app.py \<random letters\>`

    The app will start on **127.0.0.1** system port
